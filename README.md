# Project-SPCT
This is a project to make school computers usable for anything other than school. It was made by iddu01 and djsnorlax6707
Project-SPCT is completely **open source**, meaning anyone can collaborate. Below are instructions on how to collaborate. 
# Notice:
Project SPCT Premium is going to be replacing Project-SPCT basic and lite as Project-SPCT. Thanks.
# How to use
Start by going to the GitHub Releases Page and get the newest Stable release. Next, unzip the ZIP file, and open up the MAIN folder and open the html file. Now you have some options. There are three options (as of v1.1.0) you got Clockwork OS, iddu01's website (idk) and the best part, (no offence, Clockwork ;)) spct-ai. It's our all new AI. Try it out!
